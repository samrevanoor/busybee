### **Getting Started**

You can access my app [here](https://thebusybee.herokuapp.com/), and the repo [here](https://github.com/samrevanoor/busybee).

If you are looking to clone my repo to use my app on your device, make sure to download the following beforehand:
- Mongoose
- Nodemon (optional, but makes it easier)
- Method Override
- Passport
- Dotenv

I used [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/AglLSD6S/busy-bee-project-board) for my project planning. 

You can view my wireframes here (link/collapse md).

Here is my ERD: <img src="public/images/ERD">

### **Next Steps**

- Building out search functionality on the Jobs home page
- Adding a field to enter future interview dates/times for roles
- Sending text messages/email reminders a couple hours before interviews
- Using the Google Maps API to help locate where the interview will be taking place
