# The Busy Bee Job Tracker App
## by Sam Revanoor

### **Background**

For Project 2, I decided to create a job tracker app with a fun playful twist. Job hunting can be stressful and mentally exhausting but hopefully, with the help of my app, it might add a bit of fun and cheeriness.

### **Getting Started**

You can access my app here (insert link), and the repo here (insert link).

If you are looking to clone my repo to use my app on your device, make sure to download the following beforehand:
- Mongoose
- Nodemon (optional, but makes it easier)
- Method Override
- Passport
- Dotenv

I used [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/AglLSD6S/busy-bee-project-board) for my project planning. 

You can view my wireframes here (link).

Here is my ERD: (screenshot)

### **Next Steps**

- Building out search functionality on the Jobs home page
- Adding a field to enter future interview dates/times for roles
- Sending text messages/email reminders a couple hours before interviews
- Using the Google Maps API to help locate where the interview will be taking place
